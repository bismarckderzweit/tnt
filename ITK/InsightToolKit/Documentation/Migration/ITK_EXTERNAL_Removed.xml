    The defintion of ITK_EXPORT was empty in all cases

    This has been identified since 2003 as not being necessary
    for builds.  On Windows the EXPORT needs to be per library,
    and that is not controlled by CMake now.

    The PrintSelfCheck.tcl was the only remenant need for
    This patch, and that is no longer being used, so that
    file as been removed.

    The ITK_EXPORT define was set to nothing and had no
    known remaining purpose.  It was removed to make the
    over all code easier to understand.  There was,
    understandably, a bit of confusion about the
    need for this being pervasive in the code.

    It is currently backwards compatible to have
    this in code, but at some future point it will
    be removed (and is currently removed when
    ITK_FUTURE_LEGACY_REMOVE is set)
