/**
 \defgroup ITKSignedDistanceFunction Module ITKSignedDistanceFunction 
 This module contains classes for calculating signed distance
images, i.e. images of the distance from a segmenting contour (the distance is
zero on the contour, negative inside the contour, and positive outside the
contour).
